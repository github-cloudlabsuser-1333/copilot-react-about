                </h1>
                <p>
                  Welcome to the DevSecOps Mastery with GitHub Hackathon! This
                  event is your gateway to mastering DevSecOps practices within a
                  modern application environment. We have crafted this hackathon
                  to provide you with a robust learning experience, focused on
                  Contoso Traders, a hypothetical e-commerce company using a
                  React front-end, .NET back-end, and various microservices,
                  container services, AI-powered GitHub Actions, undersatnding of
                  Security compliance as code and mastering the usage of GitHub
                  Copilot.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Your goal is to integrate DevSecOps practices into Contoso
                  Traders' existing e-commerce application. As you navigate
                  through various challenges, you will gain practical experience
                  in implementing DevSecOps in an application built with a modern
                  tech stack.
